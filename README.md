## AWS account swicher

AWS CLI, have a way to switch accounts. But it's not global for all lunched consoles. It is require to export console variables witch are not visible to already lunched shells.
So i try t play with python and create this tool
It's sophisticated, it's not bulletproof but works for me.

## usage:
switch add - adding new configuration
switch change - change current settings
switch show - on what settings i'm current on
